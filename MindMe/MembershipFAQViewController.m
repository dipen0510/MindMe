Please use your discretion when including information specific to medical conditions, special requirements and other sensitive information.\n\n2) Be sure that you do not include your phone number or email address, any last names or children's names. Posts are visible to all, and we want to save your personal information for private communications.\n\n3) No specific locations or addresses. For safety purposes, we encourage sticking to the details of the job, not the precise location.\n\n4) PLEASE DO NOT WRITE IN ALL UPPER CASE LETTERS! It rather feels like we're being shouted at.\n\n5) Be sure to include enough detail about the position so that your message is clear and can be understood by a broad audience. Try to avoid abbreviations, and if you're adding a lot of content, separate into paragraphs for easier reading.\n\n6) Be sure that you have posted in the correct category, and make sure that all information is relevant to the position description.\n\n7) Your subject line should be unique and specific. Instead of just writing \"Dog Walker\", try using keywords to help your post stand out, like \"Searching for a Full-time, M-F Dog Walker\"\n\n8) Bullet Points are nice, but don't go overboard. Carers and Service Providers appreciate hearing your voice in the description, so please use complete sentences.\n\n9) Be sure that your Account Information (full name, email, phone number, etc.) is accurate. Incomplete or false information will not be approved.\n\n10) Businesses, companies, agencies, and organisations cannot use MindMe.ie to hire employees.\n\n11) Please check your spelling and grammar.
