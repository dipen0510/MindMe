How do I write a good job application?\nTo increase your chances of finding a job and receiving more responses from families, it is important to write a good job application. Here are some important tips to keep in mind when writing your job application:\nPersonalize your application. Families will be more eager to respond to your application when they see that you've taken time to really read their job post and taken into consideration their needs and job qualifications. Describe why you are a good fit for what they need.\nStand out over other job seekers. Families receive many applications and browse through many profiles on the site. You have to write something in your application that will make you stand out. Provide unique details that show who you are.\nBe brief. You don't have to tell a family your whole life story. You don't want to overwhelm them. After writing a brief introduction and summary about yourself, suggest they check out your profile. You can always get to know each other during the interview process." forKey:@"ans"];

Here are some tips to ensure your profile is the best it can be:\n\n1. Include as much information as possible. Potential employers want to get to know you through your profile. You need to be specific about why you want a job in childcare, pet care etc, and go beyond just saying that you like children or pets. \nDescribe in detail what your experience is, what tasks you performed and how long you have worked in each position. If you don't have a lot of experience, explain why you chose to go into this field, describe the skills you have that will make you a good carer and any other relevant qualifications you may have.\n\n2. Highlight your skills. It's good to show off what you are good at. If you've taken classes such First Aid, if you speak another language, teach piano, or if you are studying to be a child psychologist, these are important skills that can enhance your profile.\n\n3. Show your personality. Add information to your profile that sets you apart from other candidates, such as new hobbies, volunteer or charity work, interesting child care books you may have read, or a race you participated in. Be creative. This additional information will give a family a more complete picture of whom you really are and why you might be perfect for them.\n\n4. Be professional. Your profile may have good information, but how it is presented and written, can make a difference. Use complete sentences, don't use inappropriate language, don't use all upper case letters, and be sure to check your spelling and grammar.\n\n5. Upload a photo.

PLEASE DO NOT WRITE IN ALL UPPER CASE OR CAPITAL LETTERS!\n4. Add at least three complete sentences so that your profile is clear and can be understood by a broad audience. Try to avoid abbreviations, and if you're adding a lot of content, separate into paragraphs for easier reading.\n5. Please check your spelling and grammar. Use a spell check on your browser for assistance.\n6. Be sure you have posted in the correct category. Your child care profile should reflect your experience with child care, and the same goes for housekeeping, pet care, etc.\n7. Check that you have selected the correct type of account. For example, individual caregivers looking for a job should not post a job using a family account to advertise their services since family accounts are for those who want to hire a caregiver.\n8. Do not use bullet points. Complete sentences are preferred.\nPlease don't cut and paste a CV.

Your choice of babysitter / child carer should be based upon a number of factors, most importantly knowledge of your own children and knowledge of the babysitter/ child carers abilities. Once you have decided on and contacted a child carer, get to know the person before offering a job. You should arrange a meeting so that you can get to know them and they can get to know you and your children. Use this opportunity to ask as many questions as you can so that you have all the information to decide if the child carer is right for you and your family. \nIt is your responsibility to engage someone that is responsible, trustworthy and reliable and who will put the welfare and safety of your children before anything else." forKey:@"ans"];

They will look after your pooch while you go about you daily chores. As with all care â choose carefully.\nWhichever pet care option(s) you choose, make sure they meet and anticipate your needs (and your pet's) in the long term. If you live in an urban area, pet will be readily available but at If you live in the suburbs or a more rural area, expect to have to hunt a bit more for pet care options, but once found, you'll most likely pay less for that pet care than you would in the city.\nNo matter where you live, however, remember that pets are more affected by change than humans, and need routine and structure to be the happy and healthy. Their behaviour will depend on the regularity of care and number of caregivers." forKey:@"ans"];

Our excuse is haste, but in so many cases it is a lack of sensitivity, a sense of entitlement or even arrogance.\n\nAll of these attitudes are wrong, especially when they relate to how you treat people who have come to help you. Good relationships are built on mutual respect. Given this, no matter who you are interacting with, they are deserving of decent behaviour on your part. \n\nWhen you hire someone to come into your home to help clean, organize or manage, you expect polite behaviour and an honest effort from them: â¦you are paying them to do a job. \nTake the time to reflect on pleasantries, and show genuine interest in the person helping you; this can have huge benefits for everyone involved. \nThe cynical among you are saying, âTreat the hired help well and you get more work out of them.\" At www.MindMeCare.ie we like to think that building a solid, friendly relationship with the people you hire motivates those working for you and creates an environment of common decency. \nIt is these exchanges that set one day apart from the next. It is those opportunities to learn something new about someone, to realize hidden talents or just to have a friendly exchange of words that enrich our lives. The fact that you have the money to hire them and they require the money that you can provide should make no difference in the respect exchanged. \n\nHow many times have you heard or experienced the situation where a person hired to clean in your home has gone above their job description by doing kind 'extras' or helping you in a time of need.
